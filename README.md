A. Project Overview.

This project is a simple Java program that demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The program models students and a course, updates student data, and calculates statistics such as average GPA and total credits.
The project uses:
classes and objects, constructors, arrays, methods, encapsulation, classic for loops

B. Class Descriptions.
Student Class represents a student with the following fields: name, id, major, GPA, credits 
The class includes: a constructor to initialize student data getters and setters methods to update GPA and add credits a method to check honors status a toString() method for output

Course Class represents a course that contains an array of students (composition).
The class includes: course name and instructor methods to add students a method to calculate average GPA a method to find the student with the highest credits a toString() method

C. Instructions to Compile and Run.
Compile: javac *.java

Run: java Main

E. Reflection.

In this project, I learned how to work with multiple classes and apply OOP principles such as encapsulation and composition. I improved my understanding of arrays, methods, and loops. The project showed how OOP helps organize code and make it easier to manage and extend.
